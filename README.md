## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swervolee/Javascript-catchup.git
cd Javascript-catchup
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📖 Learning Path

### JavaScript Fundamentals

1. **Variables and Types** - Learn about `let`, `const`, `var`, and JavaScript types
2. **Functions** - Master function declarations, arrow functions, and higher-order functions
3. **Arrays** - Practice array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more
4. **Objects** - Work with object creation, methods, and destructuring
5. **Async/Promises** - Understand promises, async/await, and error handling
6. **ES6+ Features** - Explore modern JavaScript features

### React Fundamentals

1. **Components** - Create functional components and understand JSX
2. **State and Hooks** - Use `useState` for managing component state
3. **Effects** - Master `useEffect` for side effects and lifecycle
4. **Forms** - Handle form inputs and validation
5. **Advanced Hooks** - Learn `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useRef`
6. **Custom Hooks** - Create reusable custom hooks

## 💡 How to Practice

### Step 1: Start with Exercises
Open the exercise files in `javascript-fundamentals/` or `react-fundamentals/` and complete the TODOs.

### Step 2: Run Tests
After implementing a solution, run the tests to verify your code works correctly.

### Step 3: Review Solutions
If you get stuck, check the reference solutions in the `solutions/` directory.

### Step 4: Experiment
Modify the exercises and add your own variations to deepen understanding.

## 🎯 Exercise Topics

### JavaScript
- Variable declarations and scoping
- Type checking and coercion
- Arrow functions and closures
- Array methods and manipulation
- Object destructuring and spread operator
- Promises and async/await
- ES6+ features (classes, template literals, optional chaining)

### React
- Functional components and JSX
- Props and component composition
- State management with hooks
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and keys
- Side effects with useEffect
- Form handling and validation
- Context API
- Custom hooks

## 📝 Tips for Success

1. **Practice Daily** - Consistency is key to retaining knowledge
2. **Code Along** - Don't just read the solutions, type them out
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples and see what happens
4. **Build Projects** - Apply what you learn to real projects
5. **Review Regularly** - Revisit concepts you find challenging

## 🧪 Testing

All solution files include comprehensive tests to verify correctness. Tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library.
