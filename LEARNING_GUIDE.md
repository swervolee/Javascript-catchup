## Daily Routine

1. **Read (15 minutes)**
   - Review the exercise file
   - Read the topic documentation

2. **Code (45 minutes)**
   - Implement the TODO items
   - Run tests frequently
   - Experiment with variations

3. **Test (15 minutes)**
   - Run all tests
   - Debug any failures
   - Verify edge cases

4. **Review (15 minutes)**
   - Compare with solutions
   - Note areas for improvement
   - Update your learning journal

## Learning Tips

### For JavaScript
- **Console is your friend**: Use `console.log()` liberally
- **Read error messages**: They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Use MDN**: Mozilla Developer Network has excellent docs
- **Practice regularly**: Even 30 minutes daily is better than marathon sessions

### For React
- **Think in components**: Break UIs into small, reusable pieces
- **Understand data flow**: Props down, events up
- **Master hooks**: They're the foundation of modern React
- **Read the docs**: React's official docs are excellent

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### JavaScript
- ❌ Mixing up `let`, `const`, and `var`
- ❌ Forgetting to return values from functions
- ❌ Not handling promises properly
- ❌ Mutating objects/arrays instead of creating new ones

### React
- ❌ Mutating state directly
- ❌ Missing dependencies in useEffect
- ❌ Not cleaning up effects
- ❌ Overusing state (when props would work)

## Progress Tracking

Keep a learning journal:
```markdown
## Date: YYYY-MM-DD
### Topics covered:
- Topic 1
- Topic 2

### What I learned:
- Key insight 1
- Key insight 2

### Challenges faced:
- Challenge and how I solved it

### Next steps:
- What to focus on tomorrow
```

## Additional Practice Ideas

### JavaScript Projects
1. **Todo List** - Arrays, objects, functions
2. **Calculator** - Functions, operators
3. **Quiz App** - Arrays, objects, async
4. **Weather App** - Fetch API, promises
5. **Data Visualizer** - Array methods, DOM manipulation

### React Projects
1. **Counter App** - useState
2. **Todo App** - useState, arrays
3. **Weather Dashboard** - useEffect, fetch
4. **Form Builder** - Forms, validation
5. **Theme Switcher** - useContext
6. **Shopping Cart** - useReducer, complex state

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check the solution file for hints
3. Search the error on Google/Stack Overflow
4. Review the relevant documentation
5. Take a break and come back fresh

## Measuring Progress

You're making good progress when you can:
- [ ] Explain concepts in your own words
- [ ] Solve exercises without looking at solutions
- [ ] Debug errors independently
- [ ] Build small projects from scratch
- [ ] Help others understand concepts

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Build Projects**: Apply what you've learned
2. **Learn Advanced Topics**: TypeScript, Testing, Performance
3. **Contribute to Open Source**: Real-world experience
4. **Join Communities**: Share knowledge, get help
5. **Keep Practicing**: Regular coding keeps skills sharp
